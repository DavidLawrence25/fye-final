# First Year Experience (FYE): Synthesis Project

###### 100 Possible Points \| Due January 8, 2023

## Overview

I'd like to close out the semester by synthesizing everything we've done. You will need to use your critical thinking, creativity, and communication skills to take a step back and analyze how the semester went and bring it all together in a final project. This assignment will allow you to do that in any format you'd like and is a significant portion of your final grade, so please put a lot of effort into this.

## Directions

Your goal is to summarize your experience as an FYE student this semester. Specifically, explain the following:
- Detail how you've grown throughout this semester as a college freshman.
- Analyze at least 2 specific strategies you implemented and how they have improved your chances of success in college.
- Identify 1 specific strategy you still need to work on for future semesters and how you plan to improve in that area.
- Describe your favorite part of this course and why.
- Add any additional comments.
