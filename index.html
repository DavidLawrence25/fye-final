		<p>&emsp;Coming to <a href="https://nuames.org/"><abbr title="Northern Utah Academy for Math, Engineering, & Science">NUAMES</abbr></a> was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It's required me to grow in ways I never imagined, become a person I never was, and see the world in a whole new light. Before starting this semester, school was relatively easy. I attended <a href="https://sunsetjr.davis.k12.ut.us/"><abbr title="A small public middle school located in Sunset, Utah">Sunset Jr. High</abbr></a> for three years, which had a far different approach to education than NUAMES. While I did have to do copious amounts of work there, it was nowhere near enough to prepare me for this.</p>
		<p>&emsp;Starting out, I wasn't entirely sure what I was getting into. I didn't bring any friends from <abbr title="Grade 9">freshman year</abbr>, so it was just me facing the demons of high school. It didn't take long for me to notice just how much there was to do, and I had to learn to deal with that as soon as possible. <a type="button" onclick="scrollToHeading('time')"><abbr title="Jump to Section: Time Management">Managing time</abbr></a> is far from universal; everyone does it differently. Up to this point, I had tried around eight different methods and services for keeping myself on a schedule, and none seemed to work very well. Though my current methods are not as refined as they could be, they are as good as they have ever been.</p>

		<p>&emsp;My social life <abbr title="and still isn't">wasn't</abbr> terribly amazing going into this semester. As an <abbr title="people whose energy tends to expand through reflection and dwindle during interaction (excerpt from wikipedia article)"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Introversion">introvert,</a></abbr> becoming comfortable with new people is extremely challenging. In a classroom setting, I can easily be a top participant with little to no issue seeing as I reveal no personal information in doing so. Making lasting relationships requires a willingness to become vulnerable, and that is difficult to muster around those you do not trust. Thankfully, the barrier is weakening little by little as I have more meaningful conversations with others.</p>
