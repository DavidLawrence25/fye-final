		<p>&emsp;Coming to <a href="https://nuames.org/"><abbr title="Northern Utah Academy for Math, Engineering, & Science">NUAMES</abbr></a> was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It's required me to grow in ways I never imagined, become a person I never was, and see the world in a whole new light. Before starting this semester, school was relatively easy. I attended <a href="https://sunsetjr.davis.k12.ut.us/"><abbr title="A small public middle school located in Sunset, Utah">Sunset Jr. High</abbr></a> for three years, which had a far different approach to education than NUAMES. While I did have to do copious amounts of work there, it was nowhere near enough to prepare me for this.</p>
		<p>&emsp;Starting out, I wasn't entirely sure what I was getting into. I didn't bring any friends from <abbr title="Grade 9">freshman year</abbr>, so it was just me facing the demons of high school. It didn't take long for me to notice just how much there was to do, and I had to learn to deal with that as soon as possible. <a type="button" onclick="scrollToHeading('time')"><abbr title="Jump to Section: Time Management">Managing time</abbr></a> is far from universal; everyone does it differently. Up to this point, I had tried around eight different methods and services for keeping myself on a schedule, and none seemed to work very well. Though my current methods are not as refined as they could be, they are as good as they have ever been.</p>

		<p>&emsp;My social life <abbr title="and still isn't">wasn't</abbr> terribly amazing going into this semester. As an <abbr title="people whose energy tends to expand through reflection and dwindle during interaction (excerpt from wikipedia article)"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Introversion">introvert,</a></abbr> becoming comfortable with new people is extremely challenging. In a classroom setting, I can easily be a top participant with little to no issue seeing as I reveal no personal information in doing so. Making lasting relationships requires a willingness to become vulnerable, and that is difficult to muster around those you do not trust. Thankfully, the barrier is weakening little by little as I have more meaningful conversations with others.</p>

		<p>&emsp;One of the most vital skills taught in FYE was time management. As high-school/college students, there are so many things for us to do each day that we have to balance somehow. For most of the semester, AP Biology has been my primary focus due to the abnormally heavy workload; however, I took four CE courses along with two normal ones that took dilligence and discipline to pass.</p>

		<p>&emsp;We discussed many ideas for how to become more efficient with our time, such as the Eisenhower Box (developed by former US President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>). This model is meant to act as a guide for what to prioritize in a very general sense. On the other hand, we took a moment to mention that boredom is good... sometimes. Ideas can be hard to come by when our mind is constantly switching focus, so allowing it to wander can be beneficial.</p>

		<p>&emsp;So, how have I implemented these concepts? Well, around the start of the year, I remembered a <a href="https://youtube.com/@Danidev"><abbr title="Dani">YouTuber</abbr></a> I used to watch that promoted a website called <a href="https://trello.com">Trello.</a> This is designed to arrange tasks into a "board," which other people can contribute to and essentially work as a team on a particular project. I decided to give it a shot (albeit without a team), and I've been using it since then. I also use a planner on occasion, but it's less practical for me to do so. Above is a screenshot of my main board I use to track all my assignments and things like that.</p>
